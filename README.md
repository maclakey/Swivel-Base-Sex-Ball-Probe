# Swivel-Base-Sex-Ball-Probe
Sex ball probe for calibrating offsets between toolheads

This is a ball probe meant to be used with https://github.com/viesturz/NozzleAlign

BOM: 
1 - 7mm steel ball
1 - 30mmx5mm steel shaft
1 - m3x35 SHCS
2 - m3x20 SHCS
1 - m3 Brass threaded insert
1 - 12x6mm spring
1 - 80mm length of 2020 aluminum extrusion
1 - Omron 2DF-F microswitch
1 - JST 2 (or 3) pin receptical
some m3x8 screws.  no more than 8 
some m3 roll-in nuts, no more than 10
some m3 hammer head nuts

Instructions: 

Printing the parts:
Print the parts using ABS with the standard Voron print settings.
The .3mf file contains all the parts at their preferred printing orientations.  
You should not need supports.

Swivel base:
Assemble as shown in the CAD file.  
Carefully insert the heat-set brass threaded insert into the center of the Base Top.  
The spring goes on the M3x35 SHCS which then goes up through the Base Flange and screws into the brass insert in the base top.
Tighten the screw until it holds the pieces together firmly.  You should, with a little effort, be able to swivel the top which will lock into place on the alignment grooves.
Slide the extrusion into the base top.  It's a snug fit, but if you want it even more secure, you can fasten it with four m3x8 screws and 4 m3 roll-in nuts.

Nozzle Probe:
Screw the microswitch into it's place, making sure the button is visible in the hole.
Solder some lengths of wire between the microswitch and the JST receptical.
Fasten the nozzle probe to the free end of the 80mm extrusion using two m3x20 and either m3 roll-in or hammer-head nuts.

Attach to printer:
This is designed to attach to the front of the printer, assuming you have the extra frame attached for holding the docks in for TAP Changer. ( https://github.com/viesturz/tapchanger?tab=readme-ov-file )
using 4 - m3x8 screws and 4 roll-in nuts, fasten the base down to the frame so that the arm hangs over the bed.

You can now swivel the arm out of the way when not in use, and back again when/if you need to calibrate the tool offsets again.
This should keep you from having to re-calibrate the nozzle probe location.
