**BOM:** <br>
1 - 7mm steel ball<br>
1 - 30mmx5mm steel shaft<br>
1 - m3x35 SHCS<br>
2 - m3x20 SHCS<br>
1 - m3 Brass threaded insert<br>
1 - 12x6mm spring<br>
1 - 80mm length of 2020 aluminum extrusion<br>
1 - Omron 2DF-F microswitch<br>
1 - JST 2 (or 3) pin receptical<br>
some m3x8 screws.  no more than 8 <br>
some m3 roll-in nuts, no more than 10<br>
some m3 hammer head nuts<br>
<br>
**Instructions:** <br>
<br>
**Printing the parts:**<br>
Print the parts using ABS with the standard Voron print settings.<br>
The .3mf file contains all the parts at their preferred printing orientations.  <br>
You should not need supports.<br>
<br>
**Swivel base:**<br>
Assemble as shown in the CAD file.  <br>
Carefully insert the heat-set brass threaded insert into the center of the Base Top.  <br>
The spring goes on the M3x35 SHCS which then goes up through the Base Flange and screws into the brass insert in the base top.<br>
Tighten the screw until it holds the pieces together firmly.  You should, with a little effort, be able to swivel the top which will lock into place on the alignment grooves.<br>
Slide the extrusion into the base top.  It's a snug fit, but if you want it even more secure, you can fasten it with four m3x8 screws and 4 m3 roll-in nuts.<br>
<br>
**Nozzle Probe:**<br>
Screw the microswitch into it's place, making sure the button is visible in the hole.<br>
Solder some lengths of wire between the microswitch and the JST receptical.<br>
Fasten the nozzle probe to the free end of the 80mm extrusion using two m3x20 and either m3 roll-in or hammer-head nuts.<br>
<br>
**Attach to printer:**<br>
This is designed to attach to the front of the printer, assuming you have the extra frame attached for holding the docks in for TAP Changer. ( https://github.com/viesturz/tapchanger?tab=readme-ov-file )<br>
using 4 - m3x8 screws and 4 roll-in nuts, fasten the base down to the frame so that the arm hangs over the bed.<br>
now gently drop in the 30mm shaft followed by placing the ball on top.<br>
<br>
You can now swivel the arm out of the way when not in use, and back again when/if you need to calibrate the tool offsets again.<br>
This should keep you from having to re-calibrate the nozzle probe location. <br>
